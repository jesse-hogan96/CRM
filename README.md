This small program I made prompts the user to enter their First Name, Last name and their gross monthly income. This program uses the javax.swing.* package.

In return, the program calculates the End User's fictional tax, such as:


    - Federal Tax
    
    - State Tax
    
    - Social Security Tax
    
    - Medicare
     
    - Pension Plan
    
    - Health Insurance
